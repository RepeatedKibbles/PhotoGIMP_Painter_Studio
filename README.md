NOTE:  Although the project is very functional as it is and you probably can use it with minor to no problems, it's important to notice that i'm note not able to implement new features or analyse bug reports for now.
Other than that, enjoy PhotoGIMP Painter Studio! :)

# What is GIMP Paint Sudio (GPS)?

GPS is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets. Tool presets are a simply saved tool options, highly useful feature of the GIMP.

The goal of GPS is to provide an adequate working environment for graphic designers and artists to begin to paint and feel comfortable with GIMP from their first use. Later the user will change these settings based on his own workflow preferences and understanding of GIMP.

You can learn more about GPS in the [WIki](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/)

Thanks for using it! happy painting!

# Project Name
The project name = `My Name Abbreviation` + `GIMP` + `Painter`

- The word `Painter` to better explain the function of the project. GIMP is adjacent to the `P` in Painter, so the two `P` are merged.

The name of the project is **SLOS-GIMPainter**

# MyPaintBrushes-GIMP
MyPaint-Brushes for GIMP 2.10.x

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SenlinOS/databox/master/MyPaint-Brushes-for-GIMP-2.10-By_SenlinOS.jpg)

**[I](https://github.com/SenlinOS) made these MyPaint-Brushes for GIMP**.

**This brushes is not suitable for MyPaint**, such as ‚Äú002 Frame Line‚Äù in MyPaint will ‚Äúpen leaking‚Äù phenomenon.
<br />In GIMP 2.10, hold down the Shift key ‚Äú002 Frame Line‚Äù can draw a straight line.

Other brushes have also been debugged, such as ‚Äú005 Calligraph‚Äù is a hard edge.
<br />‚Äú006 Paint Brush‚Äù to draw at maximum pressure, the edges will not jagged.

**MyPaint doesn't need these brushes**, it is just designed for GIMP 2.10.
<br />And I accidentally deleted MyPaint-brushes ‚Äú.conf‚Äù file when debugging‚Ä¶

## ‚öô How to Install (using Flatpak)

This package is all about flatpak, but it also contains "just files" that you can use on any version of GIMP (.deb, .rpm, Snap, AppImage, Windows, macOS). Just check the location of the GIMP configuration files.

**Start and quit GIMP after you installed before you continue!**

### Prepare the Flatpak environment

*If you have previously had GIMP installed via .deb, .rpm, etc., please ensure you delete the directory `$HOME/.config/GIMP`, as this may cause conflicts with the Flatpak config files.*

1. First of all, you need to have the latest GIMP installed on your system [using Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/)
2. Install GIMP Flatpak through your AppCenter/Package Manager or terminal:
   ```flatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP```

# Style:
Orderly arrangement and clear classification.

### Install PhotoGIMP Painter Studio

Inside the .zip file from the [PhotoGIMP-Painter-Studio-master.zip](https://github.com/RepeatedKibbles/PhotoGIMP-Painter-Studio/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) you‚Äôll find three folders (hidden on non-Windows systems as their names begin with a dot). All of these folders have to be extracted to your `$HOME` folder, overwriting everything if you already have the same files from an older installation.

The file contains these directories:

* `.icons` (which has a new PhotoGIMP icon)
* `.local` (which contains the personalized .desktop file)
* `.var` (which contains the flatpak patch customization for GIMP 2.10+)

If you just want the PhotoGIMP customization without changing the original GIMP icon and its name, just extract only the ```.var``` folder to your home directory.

- Edit -> Preferences ->(Folders -> MyPaint Brushes).
- Click on the [Add a new folder] button to open the [SLOS_MPB] directory.
- Restart GIMP.

**Menu, Setting Installation:**

- Edit -> Preferences ->(Folders -> Brushes), (Folders -> Dynamics), (Folders -> Tool Presets)
- Click the [Add New Folder] button to open the corresponding directories in the SLOS-GIMPainter folder respectively:

	Example location: `‚ñ° /.../SLOS-GIMPainter/brushes`

	Example location: `‚ñ° /.../SLOS-GIMPainter/dynamics`

	Example location: `‚ñ° /.../SLOS-GIMPainter/tool-presets`

	**Click position 1, 2 and 3 in the screenshot to open the corresponding directory. Click OK to finish.**
	<br />(/home/.../ is the demo location, subject to the location where you store SLOS-GIMPainter)

	![brushes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SenlinOS/databox/master/SLOS-GIMPainter-Installation/1-brushes.jpg)

	![dynamics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SenlinOS/databox/master/SLOS-GIMPainter-Installation/2-dynamics.jpg)

	![tool-presets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SenlinOS/databox/master/SLOS-GIMPainter-Installation/3-tool-presets.jpg)

- Restart GIMP.

**NOTE:** Do not check the box to prevent changing the default setting of SLOS-GIMPainter.

- I didn't install SLOS-GIMPainter by copying the corresponding directory to the GIMP-Profile-Folders. Because the Checkbox cannot be canceled. (maybe you will accidentally modify the default parameters)
- My suggested method is to manually open the corresponding directory in the Project Folder by using the (Edit -> Preferences -> Folders...) of GIMP Menu.

## ‚öô How to Install (others)

Since it‚Äôs just files, the only thing you need to do is to copy all the files that reside on a particular folder from this package `/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/config/GIMP/2.10` to your GIMP‚Äôs configuration folder on each particular system, overriding the existent ones.

**Start and quit GIMP after you installed before you continue!**

The new icon needs to be set manually.

### Ubuntu Snap

Configuration folder: `$HOME/snap/gimp/47/.config/GIMP/2.10/`

Configuration folder: `$HOME/.config/GIMP/2.10/`

### macOS
